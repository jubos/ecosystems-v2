üå≤ Crypto Ecosystems is a taxonomy for sharing data around open source blockchain, Web3, cryptocurrency, and decentralized ecosystems and tying them to GitHub organizations and code repositories.

This repository is not complete, and hopefully it never is as there are new ecosystems and repositories created every day.

# How to use this taxonomy
The taxonomy can be used to generate the set of crypto ecosystems, their corresponding sub ecosystems, and repositories for a particular timestamp.

## How to Contribute
